      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Source Image Quality Makes All the Difference</h2>
      <p>Editing can only enhance what’s there. If your original photo has issues — low resolution, dim lighting, poor composition — no amount of retouching will fully compensate without trade-offs. Starting with good image properties means faster edits, more natural results, and fewer compromises. Buyers judge by first impressions, and those often come from the image before the first click.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Image Properties to Check Before Editing</h2>
      <div class="space-y-8">

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Resolution & File Size</h3>
          <p>High resolution gives you room to adjust, crop, straighten, and even upscale without visible pixelation. Ideally, use full-sensor RAW files or high-quality JPEGs (in cameras that capture fine detail). Low-res images limit how much you can improve clarity or do corrections without artifacts. Editing guides caution that low resolution is a common mistake and can’t be fixed in post. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Clarity & Focus</h3>
          <p>Ensure subject parts are sharp — walls, architectural detail, fixtures. Blurry or soft focus areas will stay problematic even after sharpening. Shots with good focus save time and preserve realism. Clarity also affects how well textures, edges, and lines respond to color and contrast edits. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. Lighting Quality & Exposure Balance</h3>
          <p>Natural light is preferable, but mixed lighting (window + indoor lighting) is very common. Check for blown highlights (e.g. sky or windows clipped), deep shadow noise, or uneven exposure. Balanced lighting allows better color correction and window pulls without extreme editing. HDR or exposure bracketing helps where lighting is very dynamic. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Composition & Perspective</h3>
          <p>Good framing, avoiding distracting elements, maintaining straight verticals and level horizons, and appropriate focal length (to reduce distortion) are important. An image with poor composition or skewed lines requires more heavy correction, which can degrade quality. Getting composition more correct from capture makes editing more effective. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">5. File Format & Bit Depth</h3>
          <p>RAW is ideal; if using JPEG, shoot at maximum quality settings. Higher bit depth preserves more color information, reducing banding when making adjustments (especially in skies or shadow recovery). Editors frequently mention RAW vs JPEG differences. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">6. White Balance & Color Casts</h3>
          <p>Check if original lighting introduces unnatural tints (yellow from indoor bulbs, green from fluorescent, bluish from shade, etc.). Proper white balance or daylight merging at capture reduces the need for heavy correction. Balanced colors aid realism and trust. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">7. Metadata & Lens-Profile Info</h3>
          <p>EXIF data, lens model, focal length, exposure settings and built-in distortion profiles can help editing tools automatically correct lens distortion or apply accurate transforms. If metadata is stripped, some automatic corrections may not work or require manual adjustment. This is often overlooked. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Capture Best Practices to Ensure These Properties</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>Use a stable tripod + level to avoid tilt and stabilize shots.</li>
        <li>Shoot in RAW (if available) to retain full color & dynamic range.</li>
        <li>Bracketing exposures in dynamic scenes (bright windows vs dim interior).</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate ambient light; avoid mixing too many light types with different color temps where possible.</li>
        <li>Use grid lines in camera to keep verticals/horizons straight.</li>
        <li>Avoid extreme wide angles unless necessary; know when lens distortion will be hard to correct.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="edit-prep-checklist">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Pre-Editing Checklist</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>Check resolution & sharpness at 100% zoom.</li>
        <li>Inspect highlights & shadows for clipping or noise.</li>
        <li>Verify white balance & presence of color cast.</li>
        <li>Look for perspective distortion, skewed verticals.</li>
        <li>Ensure metadata (lens profile, exposure settings) is intact.</li>
        <li>Crop / straighten minimally if needed before other edits.</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why These Properties Impact Final Results & Buyer Perception</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>Images that are sharp and well-exposed build credibility and trust.</li>
        <li>Listings with better visual quality often get higher engagement: more clicks, longer view times.</li>
        <li>Poor source images require heavier editing which can introduce artifacts (noise, halos, color banding).</li>
        <li>Consistent look & realistic colors reduce the risk of complaints or misunderstandings from viewers. For example, over-saturated or distorted images might appear misleading. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <details class="border rounded p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Can I salvage a low resolution photo?</summary>
        <p class="mt-2">Only to a limited extent. Upscaling tools exist, but clarity and sharpness are often limited by the original. If you know ahead of time that resolution is low, try to avoid harsh crops or large perspective corrections which reduce effective pixel area. </p>
      </details>
      <details class="border rounded p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Is it critical to shoot in RAW?</summary>
        <p class="mt-2">RAW gives more flexibility — better color fidelity, shadow/highlight recovery, less compression artifact. But high-quality JPEGs can work if well shot. The properties above matter more than format alone. </p>
      </details>
      <details class="border rounded p-4">
        <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Will correcting perspective degrade quality?</summary>
        <p class="mt-2">Some degree of cropping or distortion at edges may occur, especially with aggressive corrections. Using high resolution source and good lenses reduces visible loss. Always preview at full size and be cautious. </p>
